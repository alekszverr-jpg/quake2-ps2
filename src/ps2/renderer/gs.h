 * Brief: Minimal double-buffered Graphics Synthesizer front-end used by the PS2
 *        renderer. Owns the framebuffers and the per-frame DMA/GIF packet, and
 *        exposes what the 2D overlay needs: clear/flip, solid rectangles, and
 *        textured rectangles sampling VRAM-resident textures. The VU-accelerated
 *        3D path builds on top of this.
